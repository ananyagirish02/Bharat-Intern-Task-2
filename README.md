# Wine Quality Prediction Using Linear Regression

This repository contains the code for wine quality prediction project using linear regression. The aim of the project was to develop a model that could accurately predict the quality of wines based on several features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is called "wine quality.csv".The dataset includes the following features:

1.Fixed acidity
2.Volatile acidity
3.Citric acid
4.Residual sugar
5.Chlorides
6.Free sulfur dioxide
7.Total sulfur dioxide
8.Density
9.pH
10.Sulphates
11.Alcohol
12.Quality

## Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

1.Python
2.pandas
3.numpy
4.seaborn
5.matplotlib
6.scikit-learn

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Before building the model, we perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.

## Data Preprocessing
Here we preprocess the data by handling any missing values, scaling the features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Linear Regression Model
We build a linear regression model using scikit-learn to predict the wine quality based on the selected features.

## Evaluation Metrics
To assess the performance of the model, we calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) scores.
